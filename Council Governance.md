# Here is the proposed governance of the ERPNext Foundation. 
_Please provide your inputs, thoughts and suggestions._
  
  
**The ERPNext Foundation will be primarily run by the ERPNext Foundation Council that will consist of:**

- 2 Directors appointed by Frappe Technologies Private Limited
- 1 CEO (currently nominated by Frappe Technologies Private Limited but the Foundation Council will decide on the Mode of Appointment/Election of, and the tenure of, the CEO
- 4 Council Members elected by the ERPNext Foundation members.

**Each Foundation Member will be eligible to cast the number of votes as specified below:**

Number of votes for Foundation Members:

- Individual Member: 1 Vote.
- Silver Member: 3 Votes
- Gold Member: 5 Votes

Once the Foundation Council Members are elected, decisions will be taken by a simple majority of attending members, Each Foundation Council member will be eligible to cast one vote for all decisions taken by the Foundation Council

Foundation Council members will serve for a two year term, unless the Foundation Council decides to lessen itâ€™s term and call for elections earlier.

### How does somebody become a council member?

Elections will be announced. Anybody can stand for election. Need to be proposed and seconded by a Foundation Member of good standing. Contestant needs to be foundation member at the time of application.

### Here's the proposed schedule for the elections:

- Day 0: Elections announced
- Day 7: Last day of nomination in prescribed forms
- Day 14: Elections - Online, WhatsApp and E-Mail - all have to uniquely identify the person that the voter is voting for, for a vote to be counted.
- Day 15: Results announced.
- Day 16: Objections from Community and Foundation members against ratification of the election of any of the elected council members.
- Day 17: Foundation Council Members ratify the elected representatives.

End of the day for these schedules will be as per UTC-12 (Edward Island - US Minor Outlying Islands). Meetings and other such interactions that require the simultaneous presence of multiple people will be announced and all attendees and office bearers will need to adhere to a time zone announced by the Foundation Council.

Till the Elected & Ratified Foundation Council members are formed the Council Members consist of the Directors and CEO.

Each eligible voter will need to vote for as many choices as the number of positions that the election is for. Electors can only vote for a contestant for a maximum of the number of votes that they are eligible for. Which means:

That an individual member can cast a maximum of 1 vote for a contestant
A silver member can cast a maximum of 3 votes for a contestant.
A gold member can cast a maximum of 5 votes for a contestant.

However each voter will need to cast as many votes as the number of positions, subject to the above condition.

Eligible voters can vote for themselves, if they happen to be contesting an election.

In case a Council member resigns or is dismissed or is unable to or incapable of fulfilling her/his duties the election conforming to the above schedule will be announced as soon as practically possible.

### Decisions:

Till Election of Foundation Council Members:

All decisions needing an investment/outlay of USD 500 or more or all decisions making changes to the bylaws will need to be approved by the Foundation Members on the basis of a simple majority as per the number of votes listed afore.

Such decisions need to be ratified by the current Foundation Council consisting of 2 * Frappe Directors and CEO.

Other decisions involving an investment of under USD500.00 and not making any changes to the bylaws may be taken by the current Foundation Council consisting of 2 * Frappe Directors and CEO.

After Foundation Council Members are elected:

All decisions will be made by a simple majority of the attending Foundation Council members. But Foundation Members will be consulted and opinions sought on all major decisions.

One of the first decisions the elected Foundation Council members will make is the mode of appointment or election of the CEO and the tenure.
